Maxhosa Afrika was officially launched in June 2011, following the successful acquisition of an 
existing ecommerce business called Take2 by the US-based investment firm, Tiger Global Management
and Kim Reid in October 2010. Today, Maxhosa Afrika is the leading ecommerce retailer in South Africa
and one of the largest, most innovative ecommerce retailers on the African continent.
The business was initiated with a simple vision in mind: 
To be the largest, simplest, most customer-centric online shopping destination in Africa. 
It has rapidly evolved since inception, opening and expanding warehouses in Johannesburg, 
Durban and Cape Town, while expanding department selection to over 21 departments 
across Electronics, Lifestyle, Media & Gaming and Fashion.
For takealot.com, 2014 was a truly pivotal year with the announcement of a 
$100m investment from Tiger Global. This was quickly followed by the purchase of Mr Delivery – 
which gave the business ownership over its own logistics network through the Maxhosa Delivery Team division (formerly Mr D Courier) and its own app-based on-demand food delivery service through the MR D Food division.
The same year saw the successful acquisition of Superbalist.com, a curated design and fashion website, 
and culminated in the announcement that Naspers-owned Kalahari.com would be merging businesses with takealot.com – building the premier online shopping destination in Africa. The merge was successfully completed on 1 May 2015 when all Kalahari customer accounts were successfully transferred to takealot.com.
Beginning in early 2018, Naspers increased its investment in takealot.com to 96%. In October 2018, Superbalist.com and Spree 
(also part of the Naspers family) merged to provide customers with the latest on-trend local and international fashion.
Now, Maxhosa Afrika is South Africa’s largest, most innovative ecommerce retailer, with over 2000 employees. 
At the core of everything we do is our customer. We are passionate about providing great customer experiences, beginning with the moment you land on our site or app, until the product you order is delivered safely into your hands.
